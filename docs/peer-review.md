We got some amazing feedback from students on ways to improve our project and our documentation. First, our documentation needs a bit of a touch-up to help potential collaborators navigate our GitHub as well as just general readability. Next was our project feedback, which was very helpful in adding some new blocks such as the rest, repeat measure, and dynamic block. The rest block is a great idea for general music composition; the repeat measure block will help users create more than one measure, and the dynamic block is a little more special. Right now it allows us to mark measures with the type of measure they are. However, this could also help with sheet music generation down the line. We didn't plan to add this type of functionality as we wanted to focus on just music composition. However, this would expand the project's scope to allow for more accessibility for users. While we still don't have any plans to create the sheet music generation, the dynamic block will help identify measures and could help us create said functionality.
